# Advanced-Disk-Scheduling-Simulator

📖 Overview
Understanding disk scheduling in operating systems can be challenging. It's a dynamic process that's often difficult to visualize using traditional classroom methods — which typically rely on static diagrams and theoretical explanations.

The Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator was built to solve this problem by making disk scheduling interactive, visual, and fun to learn.

💡 Why This Simulator?
Students deserve more than just chalkboard algorithms.
This web-based tool helps learners actively explore and understand how different disk scheduling algorithms work in real-time.

🖥️ Features
✅ Custom Input – Enter your own sequence of disk requests

✅ Set Initial Head Position – Choose where the head starts

✅ Select from 6 Algorithms:

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

SCAN

C-SCAN

LOOK

C-LOOK

✅ Real-Time Visualization – Watch how the disk head moves step-by-step

✅ Performance Comparison – Instantly view and compare metrics like:

Total head movement

Seek time

🎯 Project Objectives
🔹 Make learning interactive – because seeing is understanding

🔹 Visualize algorithm behavior – step-by-step, live

🔹 Compare performances – using real metrics

🔹 Keep it simple – intuitive UI for students and instructors

🔹 Bridge the gap – from classroom theory to real-world practice

👩‍🏫 Developed Under the Guidance Of
@Nadia Ma'am – whose valuable mentorship helped shape and refine this project.

📚 Who Is This For?
This simulator is ideal for:

Students learning about Operating Systems

Teachers explaining disk scheduling concepts

Anyone curious about how these algorithms perform in action
